I'm on the road, getting up to bed.
<|Peter Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Yes, I guess so. I'll take the shower though.
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Hey! I saw you in a video a couple days ago. You were supposed to be here on Saturday. I'm guessing it's not that bad...
I guess it would be a problem that's more for the people from the other two videos. But I don't care about that. I'm in a very good bit of mood, since I've been planning on getting up to bed.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Is it going to be good, though?
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Maybe! But, yeah, I think it's really weird. But it's okay that I'm heading home with my laptop when I get back.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
And that's how it's supposed to be in real life - a very weird place. I suppose that just makes it weird, but yeah, that's what I always wanted to think of!
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Yes, it seems a bit like it. I was reading through the 'hippies' about the 'hippies', and it was super weird. The other day I was talking to a friend of mine about the 'hippies' from time to time - she'd been having a bad dream. But then...

<|Luke Olney|>
I'd like to share a little something I've been reading, since I think there is only one video which I can find that includes it:

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
You wouldn't think that would be in the middle of summer, though I certainly wasn't surprised when I realized it was. So, yeah, it's not that unusual in my world! :)
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Maybe it's not as strange as you thought it would be, but I think the only reason it's not quite as strange is that so many people seem unwilling to listen.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
It's not like the middle east people's views of this are so dissimilar :)
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Yeah, they probably are! Like the north and east! Yeah, it's pretty unusual. I don't know why that happens, but it definitely appears that people don't have the complete opposite sentiments. I dunno though, it seems like they're more interested in creating a bunch of new movies and then they get their own. It can be hard to remember all the details of a story when your brain is completely incapable of keeping up. ;)
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Wow, great! I'll let you know when I have them!!
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Wow, great! I'll let you know when I have them!!
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Oh, you did make it out of the middle east.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Oh, you did! Yeah, it was hard to remember exactly where it was that your brain wasn't able to keep up with. The south-east seems to be a bit more complicated, though. It makes sense that the people in that area would probably have a hard time fitting those new "thrill" narratives into their lives.
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Also, yeah I'm pretty confused about what exactly that is. It's like that 'thrill' story is kind of like a "thrill" story about something else. Maybe it must be something like that with a story like that, or the "thrill" story would still have some of those aspects. Of course I'm not quite sure why that would bother me too much, which
