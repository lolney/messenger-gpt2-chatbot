So, doesn't that sound familiar to you?
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Yes and no. 
But it does seem weird to see that it sounds like a reference to the character Olney in the first few episodes. You can't say that like the girl from the first few seasons without having to use a bunch of homos. 

Also, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think our civilization is pretty short, and that the notion of a 'civilization' is strange. Like, "what's it like to live among such a bunch of homosexually diverse people?" But that is really how we got into it. It doesn't make much sense to me, but I do think that the idea of cities being dominated by homos is weird.  I see the lack of homogeneity as the main stumbling block to our civilization, and we have lots of homosexually diverse communities across the world. Although I think that it's important to emphasize that a civilization cannot be dominated by homosexually diverse people, which is why we need cities. The idea is that the population of a given country is related to the population of those countries: what's more important is to reduce the homogeneity, so that no country can be dominated indefinitely - it's not easy, but it does make sense.

The point is that cities could actually be a good deal more interesting, so the point is that we shouldn't get out of it entirely. However - if one nation's population is concentrated in one area, making it very hard to form strong and long-term relationships amongst multiple countries - which is what we're trying to do in "civilization." 
Have you ever mentioned that that's more valuable to an economy if you are interested, or will it always remain that way?
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Interesting. That might be the point.  That's a different question.
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Have you tried it?

Did I ever mention that a lot of the time you'd expect to hear a reference to this?
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
Yeah, quite a few times.
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
Do you think that the population would always maintain a sense of self-worth?
I think what a lot of people would assume is that a big city doesn't affect it that way, but I actually found out that was not necessarily the case.  The population seems to have a self-image for itself from the population in large-scale cities.

You could also say, more generally, that cities have a sense of self-worth because they're surrounded by very good roads.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
I guess it's not a complete rejection of a general theory of urban development!
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
I think city planning would be a different animal - more focused on density, but still largely concerned with population and transit.  Cities often lack social function and generally have a very broad social system (like a hierarchy of public utilities). Cities should exist though, which allows cities to offer more specific services and have their own communities.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
It'd be interesting to see how much of that you could get - in that, as many cities seem to share a common concept.
<|Ted Olney-Bell|>

<|Luke Olney|>
In any situation, cities would tend to be more desirable in general rather than limiting their own cities. Cities could also be more common in the future, since most of the cities of the past 10+ years had large public transportation systems.
And maybe there'd be a variety of other things where the density will decrease (like in this case, the downtown area). I don't know what that would entail, but there could be some examples of cities being more heavily populated and having dense public housing. Cities that rely on social services would be more popular too.
<|Luke Olney|>

<|Ted Olney-Bell|>
So in that sense, the whole idea of cities is more like "what would you want for Christmas, anyway? Something more like a city."

Which kind of city do you think is most common, or least useful to people who want to visit
